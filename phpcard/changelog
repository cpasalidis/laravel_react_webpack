This project will handle cards each card is a title/imgurl

Added on actions/cards.js the getHeaders() fuction which handles csrf, so now the react app is shown on my browser
Installed and configured babel preset react app using https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-preset-react-app
Put css to css directory based on https://laracasts.com/discuss/channels/laravel/best-way-to-use-custom-css-in-laravel
Used https://dev.to/devtalhaakbar/reactjs-and-laravel---running-through-a-basic-setup---part-1-ei8
to make react app files, look similar to regular react applications. And also to use boostrap4/reactstrap/popper for gui components

changed .env to connect to sqlite3 instead of mysql
I guess the .env file is now the only place to configure it.

Doc: https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/database

DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
DB_DATABASE=database/database.sqlite

Thanks a lot Jaime.

Installed php7 to /usr/local/bin and made a special .sh to have it in PATH, before the default php5.5 Installed composer on /usr/local/bin/ and used it to install laravel and to create a new project.
