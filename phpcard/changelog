This project will handle cards each card is a title/imgurl

changed .env to connect to sqlite3 instead of mysql
I guess the .env file is now the only place to configure it.

Doc: https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/database

DB_CONNECTION=sqlite
DB_DATABASE=database/database.sqlite

Thanks a lot Jaime.

Installed php7 to /usr/local/bin and made a special .sh to have it in PATH, before the default php5.5 Installed composer on /usr/local/bin/ and used it to install laravel and to create a new project.
